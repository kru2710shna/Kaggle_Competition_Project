# Machine Learning Projects 

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects, including a Kaggle competition project, that I have worked on. Each project focuses on solving different machine learning problems and demonstrates various techniques, algorithms, and tools used in the field of data science.

## Project List

1. **Spaceship Titanic: Predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension**
   - Kaggle Competition: [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spaceship-titanic)
   - Description: In this Kaggle competition, the goal is to predict which passengers on the Spaceship Titanic are transported to an alternate dimension. It involves exploring the Titanic dataset, performing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building predictive models.
